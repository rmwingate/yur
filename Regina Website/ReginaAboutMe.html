<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<h4>A Sociable Mechanical Engineer</h4>
<p1>Striving to merge my passions for technical design and helping people.</p1>
<p>I have a strong desire to learn, which makes any field - no matter my level of experience - both enticing and attainable. I aim to always work harder, do more, and improve upon myself, so that I may be in the best position to help those who need it the most.</p>
<p>My personal interests - being primarily hiking and reading - tend to mimic my professional; in that I enjoy being on the go, moving quickly yet methodically, thinking through each step I make, while maintaining a sense of extrospection and understanding of the importance of adaptability.</p>
